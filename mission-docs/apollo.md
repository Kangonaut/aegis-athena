# 5 APOLLO

# 5.1 Naming

The acronym APOLLO (Advanced Pod for Outer-space Lunar Landing Operations) indicates both the function of this vessel, as well as the divine complexity of such an ambitious mission.

The idea of the name naturally stems from the god "Apollo", found both in Greek and Roman mythology. He is referred to as *Alexicacus*, the *averter of evil*, which emphesizes our ensured success over the Guild. Moreover, Aegis Athena is also a big step towards a permanent colony, as well as military presence in lunar orbit and on its surface. In that sense, the Aegis Athena mission can be described as the birth hour of our own god, Apollo. The spirit, who will be the *averter of evil* for all lunar generations to come.
