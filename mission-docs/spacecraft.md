# S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T.

## Naming

S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. = Superb Pod for Astronaut Carriage, Exploration, Communication, Recovery, And Future Travels

## Purpose

S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. is a command and service module. It is designed to facilitate the crew during most of the space travel, thus also has all the life support systems needed to accomodate the crew. It has propulsion systems to do the hohmann transfer from earth to the moon, from the moon back to the earth and also the de-orbit maneuvor to start the re-entry process. For the most part of the mission it is connected with the A.P.O.L.L.O. (lunar lander) module, except for when it is used to bring 2 astronauts onto the lunar surface (while the command and service module remains in orbit with 1 astronaut). It also has a communications module to communicate with earth and the A.P.O.L.L.O. module.

## Systems

### EPS (Electrical Power System)

Provides power to all electrical systems and parts of the S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. module.

Power is provided using fuel cells (2 fuel cell modules, 1 as backup). They use hydrogen and oxygen to generate electrical power and drinkable water as a byproduct. The oxygen is stored in liquid form (LOX). There are two LOX tanks: a main one and a auxiliary one as a backup. The hydrogen is also stored in liquid form (LH2). There are also two LH2 tanks (one main and one backup). The backup is important, since it provides two essential ressources: electrical power and water. The energy is stored in a silver-zinc battery (again main and auxiliary). The system is controlled by a EPS controller.

### SPS (Service Propulsion System)

The SPS is responsible for adjusting course. It is used to perform the Hohmann transfer from earth orbit to lunar orbit, the Hohmann transfer from lunar orbit back to earth orbit and the de-orbit maneuver to start the re-entry process. In order to do this, the S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. module is equipped with a Aerojet AJ10 vacuum optimized engine. The engine is mounted on a gimbal, to allow for Thrust Vector Control (TVC). The propellant consists of hydrazine as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide as oxidizer. This fuel mix is hyperbolic, which means that it ignites spontaneously when mixed together. The fuel and oxidizer are stored in seperate tanks.

### Environmental Control System (ECS)

The Environmental Control Subsystem (ECS) enables pressurization of the cabin, controls the temperature of electronic equipment, and provides breathable oxygen for the astronauts. It also provides water for drinking, cooling, fire extinguishing, and food preparation.

subsystems: 
 - water management section (WCS)
 - Oxygen supply and cabin pressure control section (OSCPCS)
 - Atmosphere Revitalization System (ARS)
 - Heat transport section (HTS)

## 2.3 Systems

### 2.3.1 Electrical Power System (EPS)

Representing the lifeblood of all on-board operations, the Electrical Power System (EPS) breathes energy into every electrical part and function of the S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. module.

#### 2.3.1.1 Fuel Cell

The heart of the EPS consists of two fuel cell modules. These fuel cells, functioning in perfect synchronization, use hydrogen and oxygen in a controlled chemical reaction to generate electricity. An additional third fuel cell module lurks in the shadows, ready to assume functionality if the need arises, providing an essential backup system.

Crucially, the byproduct of the power generation process, apart from waste heat, is water — a precious and life-sustaining commodity for our crew of astronauts during their momentous journey.

#### 2.3.1.2 Fuel Storage

Both oxygen and hydrogen, the vital fuels for the power cells, are stored in liquid form due to their storage efficiency at low temperatures.

The Liquid Oxygen (LOX) is stored in two separate tanks, a primary and an auxiliary unit to provide a reliable backup. Similarly, Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) is preserved in two distinct tanks, one serving as the operative unit and the other as a fail-safe.

#### 2.3.1.3 Battery

Having a backup system for a mission of this magnitude is not a luxury; it's a necessity. Every resource, including power and water, is critical for the lunar mission's success. Recognizing the significance of redundancy, the S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. is equipped with a primary and auxiliary silver-zinc battery system. This system functions as an emergency power reservoir and buffer during peak consumption periods, thereby ensuring uninterrupted power supply.

#### 2.3.1.4 Control System

Directing the course of the EPS is the EPS Controller, a master maestro conducting this symphony of power production, distribution, and storage. It regulates INPUT from the fuel cells, allots OUTPUT to the different systems, and toggles between the primary and backup systems as required.

The EPS, with its harmonious orchestra of power production, storage systems, and well-coordinated control unit, safeguards all electrical functions on the S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T., turning the wheel of scientific discovery and human ingenuity on its journey to the moon and back.

### 2.3.2 Service Propulsion System (SPS)

The Service Propulsion System (SPS) is the powerhouse of the S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. module, responsible for orchestrating the profound ballet of interstellar navigation and ensuring accurate course alterations during the lunar mission.

#### 2.3.2.1 Core Functionality

The predominant responsibility of the SPS is to perform the intricate Hohmann transfer maneuvers, which are paramount in guiding the module from the Earth's orbit to the lunar orbit, and back. Further, the SPS shoulders the critical function of facilitating the de-orbit maneuver, a carefully calculated sequence that initiates the re-entry process, marking the initiation of the return journey.

#### 2.3.2.2 Engine and Thrust Vector Control (TVC)

At the heart of the SPS beats the Aerojet AJ10, a vacuum-optimized engine celebrated for its precision and reliability. The engine, housed in an innovative pivoting mount — a gimbal — facilitates Thrust Vector Control (TVC). This set-up allows for meticulous directional adjustments of the propulsion, enabling precise navigation and trajectory modifications, crucial for the complexities of space travel.

#### 2.3.2.2 Propellant and Storage

Powering the AJ10 engine is the volatile yet efficient mix of Hydrazine (fuel) and Nitrogen Tetroxide (oxidizer). This particular choice of hypergolic propellants boasts a dependable characteristic — it spontaneously ignites upon contact, negating the need for a separate ignition system and reducing potential points of failure.

While offering optimal reactivity, these substances are kept in separate tanks for safety and controlled use. This precise isolation prevents premature combustion, ensuring the fuel is available precisely when required, and in the controlled manner necessary for mission success.

Your journey aboard the S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T., through the vast cosmos to the lunar landscape, is driven by the powerful Service Propulsion System – a testament to humanity's ingenuity to transcend Earthly confines and reach for the stars and beyond.
