# S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T.

## Naming

S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. = Superb Pod for Astronaut Carriage, Exploration, Communication, Recovery, And Future Travels

## Purpose

S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. is a command and service module. It is designed to facilitate the crew during most of the space travel, thus also has all the life support systems needed to accomodate the crew. It has propulsion systems to do the hohmann transfer from earth to the moon, from the moon back to the earth and also the de-orbit maneuvor to start the re-entry process. For the most part of the mission it is connected with the A.P.O.L.L.O. (lunar lander) module, except for when it is used to bring 2 astronauts onto the lunar surface (while the command and service module remains in orbit with 1 astronaut). It also has a communications module to communicate with earth and the A.P.O.L.L.O. module.

## Systems

### EPS (Electrical Power System)

Provides power to all electrical systems and parts of the S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. module.

Power is provided using fuel cells (2 fuel cell modules, 1 as backup). They use hydrogen and oxygen to generate electrical power and drinkable water as a byproduct. The oxygen is stored in liquid form (LOX). There are two LOX tanks: a main one and a auxiliary one as a backup. The hydrogen is also stored in liquid form (LH2). There are also two LH2 tanks (one main and one backup). The backup is important, since it provides two essential ressources: electrical power and water. The energy is stored in a silver-zinc battery (again main and auxiliary). The system is controlled by a EPS controller.

### SPS (Service Propulsion System)

The SPS is responsible for adjusting course. It is used to perform the Hohmann transfer from earth orbit to lunar orbit, the Hohmann transfer from lunar orbit back to earth orbit and the de-orbit maneuver to start the re-entry process. In order to do this, the S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. module is equipped with a Aerojet AJ10 vacuum optimized engine. The engine is mounted on a gimbal, to allow for Thrust Vector Control (TVC). The propellant consists of hydrazine as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide as oxidizer. This fuel mix is hyperbolic, which means that it ignites spontaneously when mixed together. The fuel and oxidizer are stored in seperate tanks.

### Environmental Control System (ECS)

The Environmental Control Subsystem (ECS) enables pressurization of the cabin, controls the temperature of electronic equipment, and provides breathable oxygen for the astronauts. It also provides water for drinking, cooling, fire extinguishing, and food preparation.

subsystems: 
 - water management section (WCS)
 - Oxygen supply and cabin pressure control section (OSCPCS)
 - Atmosphere Revitalization System (ARS)
 - Heat transport section (HTS)

# 2 S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T.

## 2.1 Naming

The calculator of our celestial dreams, the bearer of the torch of human curiosity that stands ready to illuminate the untouched lunar milieu, is our meticulously designed command and service module — fondly christened as "S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T.".

This intriguing yet purposeful acronym beholds much more than just a mission to get astronauts from Earth to the tantalizing Luna. Behind the acronym "S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T." (Superb Pod for Astronaut Carriage, Exploration, Communication, Recovery, And Future Travels) is embarked the myriad purpose the spacecraft is intended to meet.

At the heart of this naming lies the expansive objectives the module aims to fulfill. S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. is a universal testament to its etymological roots:

 - **Superb Pod:** Indicative of the model's formidable and state-of-the-art design capabilities.
for Astronaut Carriage: Reifying its core purpose of carrying the mission's astronaut trio to the moon and back.

 - **Exploration:** A testament to the prime objective of exploring unseen aspects of the moon.

 - **Communication:** Highlighting the fireplace where interaction dances between Earth and space - a hallmark to its inherent communication apparatus.

 - **Recovery:** Emphasizing the design consideration for contingencies during the recovery phase.

 - **And Future Travels:** Reinforcing the module's potential as a precursor model for future space voyages.

This naming was carefully chosen to communicate our ambitious project's purpose and goals, in a way that is unique, yet informative — standing as a beacon of our roboust commitment toward space travel and exploration. It is more than just an acronym, it is an embodiment of humanity's unyielding spirit of discovery and the many hopes pinned on our journey to the moon.

## 2.2 Purpose and Function of the S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. Module

The S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. module embraces a dual-function profile as both a command and service module, conceiving a harmonious blend of functional efficiency and comfort — a veritable home in the cosmos for our brave trio of astronauts.

### 2.2.1 Crew Accommodation and Life Support

Designed with a deep understanding of the complexities and challenges of prolonged space travel, the S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. delivers all essential life support systems. From breathable air, temperature regulation, to waste disposal and radiation protection, every necessity has been considered and integrated meticulously. It further provisions well-designed living quarters and workstations — an epitome of in-orbit ergonomic design and habitation safety.

### 2.2.2 Propulsion

S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. props its heart on a cutting-edge propulsion system. This module shoulders the responsibility of performing the Hohmann Transfer, which essentially propels the craft from Earth to the Moon and vice versa, with minimal fuel expenditure. The propulsion system further makes possible the critical de-orbit maneuver enabling the re-entry process — the homecoming of our brave explorers.

### 2.2.3 Interaction with the A.P.O.L.L.O. Module

For a substantial fraction of the mission, the S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. cohabits with A.P.O.L.L.O., the lunar lander module. While an operative duo will utilize the A.P.O.L.L.O. module for their historic voyage to the harsh lunar landscapes, one astronaut will remain aboard the S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. module, maintaining orbit around the moon. This orbital configuration opens up avenues for off-lunar experiments, providing insights into the moon's gravitational field and broadening our lunar comprehension.

### 2.2.4 Communication Module

An essential organ of the S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. module is its cognitively advanced communication module. This integrated system enables unswerving communication channels between Earth, encapsulating the cogs of crucial information exchange in every phase of the journey. Beyond conversing with Earth, the module facilitates constant communication with the A.P.O.L.L.O. module, ensuring unremitting coordination during the mission's course.

Envisaged in the spirit of precision and innovation, S.P.A.C.E.C.R.A.F.T. stands as an exemplary paean to human ingenuity. The careful design renditions translate into a formidable vessel intended to ferry humanity toward our closest cosmic neighbor, whilst catering to the crew's needs, ensuring their safety, and preserving our hopes for lunar exploration and beyond.
